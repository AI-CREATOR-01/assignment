In other words, the model has learned the training data too well and is unable to generalize to new data. The consequences of overfitting include poor performance on test data, and a lack of generalizability in the model.\n",

In other words, the model is too simple and cannot fit the training data well. The consequences of underfitting include poor performance on training and test data, and an inability to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",

    "To mitigate overfitting, several techniques can be used. One common technique is to use regularization, such as L1 or L2 regularization, which adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent the model from overfitting. Another technique is to use early stopping, which stops the training process when the performance on the validation data stops improving. Data augmentation, such as adding noise or introducing randomness to the data, can also help mitigate overfitting.\n",

Another approach is to use more advanced algorithms, such as gradient boosting or deep learning, which are better at capturing complex patterns in the data. Additionally, more data can be collected or generated to help the model learn the underlying patterns."

    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that refers to the problem of balancing the two sources of errors, bias and variance, that can impact the performance of a model. Bias is the error that results from the simplifying assumptions made by a model to make the problem more manageable. Variance, on the other hand, is the error that results from the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data.\n",

    "In machine learning, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict unseen data. However, achieving this goal is challenging due to the bias-variance tradeoff. A model with high bias is too simplistic and cannot capture the complexity of the data, leading to underfitting. Conversely, a model with high variance is too complex and overfits the training data, leading to poor generalization.\n",

Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the objective function that discourages the model from using complex features.
